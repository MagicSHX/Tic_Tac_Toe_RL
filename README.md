## General info
My insterest is in Reinforcement learning and multi-agent system, using project like this to practice and gain experience.

## Demo
![Example Demo](img/AI.gif)

## Technologies
* Python 3 - pytorch
* Python 3 - tkinter

## Setup
* Download project into local folder
* For playing game, please open "Game UI.ipynb" and execute, you will see a window pops-up as per demo
* For training the Reinforcement Learning model, please open "" and execute. There are few parameters can be setup before execution:

Show examples of usage:
`put-your-code-here`

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Reinforcement Learning model, to let AI plays against last version of AI, to gain training data. Then enahnced training data will be used to continue training latest AI model.
* A simple game UI has been developed, to provide an interface for human player plays with AI model.
* machine learning model used for this model is light level. (pt model is only 24 kb)

To-do list:
* Will develop a "Connect Four" game with Reinforcement learning model,as the game itself is more fair to both players, compared with current game.
* Add some noise(random steps) into training output, so that AI can practice more scenarios automatically, without relying too much on initial training data.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
